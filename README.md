<h2 id="motivation" > ðŸŽ¯ Motivation </h2>

Accurate assessment of mortality risk of the patients at the time of admission has to be made inorder to determine and make available, the medical resources required for the patient.

  Rather than going the conventional way of checking vital signs of the patients, details regarding quickly repeatable and efficient laboratory tests have been used as the features for building the model.  
  
  Due to the quick repetitive nature of the tests, these features can be used for generating a quick assesment of the mortality condition of the patient. Leveraging these sets of features, this app determines whether a patient admitted to a hospital has a high risk of mortality
or not.
